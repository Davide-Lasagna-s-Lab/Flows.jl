# Flows.jl
A flow-like API to solve differential equations. 

## Rationale
Many numerical algorithms in dynamical systems theory require the action of a flow operator associated to a dynamical system, rather than a solve-an-initial-value-problem-and-store-its-solution approach. This package provides an API geared towards this needs, without the ambition to be a general purpose package.
