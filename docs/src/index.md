# Flows.jl
This package offers a flow-like API to solve differential equations. The reason this package exists is that many numerical algorithms in dynamical systems theory require the action of a flow operator associated to a dynamical system, rather than a solve-an-initial-value-problem-and-store-its-solution approach that is available from other packages.
