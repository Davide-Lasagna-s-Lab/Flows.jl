    Coupled{N, ARGS<:NTuple{N, Any}} <: AbstractVector{Any}

Couple together `N` objects and store them internally in a Julia `ntuple` of size `N`.

Coupled` objects are immutable, but their elements must be mutable, allowing the 
content to be modified. The individual elements of a `Coupled` object can be 
accessed using the standard indexing notation, but the elements
cannot be changed, i.e. there is no `Base.setindex!` defined for `Coupled` objects.
